hello
0:05
i'm todd younkin the new president and
0:08
ceo
0:08
of semiconductor research corporation on
0:12
behalf of src and its members
0:14
it's my pleasure to welcome you to
0:15
techcon 2020.
0:18
techcon is a special event because it
0:20
celebrates the hard work and
0:21
accomplishments of our outstanding
0:23
student researchers across all of src's
0:26
programs
0:28
of course covet 19 has made this year a
0:30
trying one for all
0:32
and while it's unfortunate we can't
0:34
congregate in texas to physically
0:36
connect
0:37
i'm happy to have you participate in our
0:39
first ever virtual techcon
0:42
our staff has been working hard behind
0:43
the scenes to make sure this year's
0:45
event
0:46
brings together our community of
0:47
academic and industrial scientists
0:50
in smart and engaging ways we do however
0:53
encourage
0:54
all of you to use this opportunity to
0:56
seek out and make new connections
0:59
either during or after the conference
1:02
see an interesting talk and have
1:03
questions about the research or the
1:05
researchers assumptions
1:07
connect with the author to learn more
1:10
see a promising student that might make
1:12
a good intern or full-time hire drop
1:14
them a note
1:15
and get to know them and their personal
1:17
interests
1:19
our guidebook app makes it easy to check
1:21
in and connect
1:22
with registered conference attendees
1:25
right now it's easy to feel isolated and
1:27
to become disconnected
1:29
however recall that innovation is best
1:32
when exploring your ideas as part of a
1:34
scientific community
1:36
thankfully src forms one vibrant
1:39
community of learning
1:40
and curiosity so i hope you enjoy this
1:44
year's techcon
1:45
and they come next fall we're all able
1:48
to celebrate again
1:49
in person in austin
2:06
you
